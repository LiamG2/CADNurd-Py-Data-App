# Sligo Weather Report - a basic Web App - exploring Python-Only Frameworks

A basic Web App which automatically updates itself (every 10 mins) with the latest weather reports relevant to the town/city of Sligo in Ireland. See link below.

Deployed, running reliably, and hosted for free at >> https://sligo-weather-report.streamlit.app

## Description

$^{Note\ to\ self:\ Do\ NOT\ rename\ this\ repo\ if\ still\ using\ Streamlit\ -\ it\ won't\ like\ that.}$

Currently scrapes data from https://www.met.ie/connacht-forecast.html - which unfortunately does not provide short, text-only weather reports for individual towns. Sligo sits on the border between two provinces, Connacht and Ulster. I could have added both provinces but having just the one makes it less confusing; I chose Connacht. Completely *re-inventing-the-wheel* here, but it works, and I'm proud of it :)
