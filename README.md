# Sligo Weather Report - a basic Web App - exploring Python-Only Frameworks

A basic Web App which automatically updates itself (every 10 mins) with the latest weather reports relevant to the town/city of Sligo in Ireland. See link below.

https://sligo-weather.streamlit.app

## Description

Currently scrapes data from https://www.met.ie/ - which unfortunately does not provide short, text-only weather reports for individual towns. Sligo sits on the border between two provinces, Connaught and Ulster, so for now I'll leave it as is, showing the most up-to-date reports for those two provinces. Completely 're-inventing the wheel' here, but it works, and I'm proud of it :)
